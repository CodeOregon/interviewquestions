Developer Interview Questions

When my candidates find a new job, I recently started asking them what interview questions they were asked. Here is what they reported (so far) to help you prepare for your next interview:

22.	The interview started with a personality test. There were 16 groups of 8 adjectives on a piece of paper, and I was instructed to indicate which word most described me, and which least described me. I'm unsure if they put all of their interviewees through this process, or only the ones applying for a customer-facing position. After I finished the personality test, the interviewers came in (there were two of them). They started with "tell me about yourself." After that, we talked in general about my previous role, and discussed my previous customer service experience, as this is a customer-facing position. They were not reading from a list of predefined questions that they ask every candidate, but seemed to be trying to get a feel for if I would be a good cultural fit. Somewhere in there, they also asked where I wanted to be in five years, or something similar about my future.
23.	Describe a situation where a team disagreed strongly with an idea you had and how you handled it
24.	Describe a time when you had to collaborate on a team
25.	Took a personality test, which was about 25 questions with 4 answers where you pick the most relevant and least relevant answer to you
26.	How do you deal with a customer that is unhappy?


Sr C# Developer insight 

A Senior C# Developer provided this insight on his experience interviewing:

Phone screen questions to try to round down the selection process. These guys would do just as well to just flip a coin to eliminate people as their process is almost never statistically valid in that they don't ask enough questions. There are literally 100,000 questions they might ask, (Because these questions are vocabulary tests) and as an interviewee who is skilled in the topic areas, the results will follow a bell curve with them.  Since most people use this technique, it makes it all about the numbers to get by this stage.  I have sometimes scored perfect for jobs I was barely qualified for, and missed them all for jobs I was immensely qualified for.  Often, they will ask for as many as ten skill sets on the description, and then ask specific questions from only one or two of them.   
1.  What is a class in CSS
2.  What are elements in HTML
3.  What are the seven abstractions in network communications
4.  What is DNS
5.  What is a join, and give an example of using it
6.  What are the levels of Normalization in a database design

Support staff ask a series of questions and match the responses to an answer sheet. They are looking for a match of another keyword that is in their list.  Typical questions are: 
1.  Name the differences between an abstract class and an interface.
2.  What does encapsulation mean?
3.  What is inheritance.
4.  Name patterns you have used.

Interviewers who are heavy on the HR side ask questions that sound like serious questions that might take a serious person a lot of time to answer, and a deep thinker will almost always fail their interviews.  You have to approach these questions as if they were not actually asking the questions they are asking, but something much more superficial.  They also are more interested in the idea that you want to work for their particular company, and will ask you what you know about their company.  
1.  What do you desire out of work?
2.  What is truly important to you?
3.  Name an example of a time you were behind on several deadlines at once, and how you managed it.  
4. Give an example of when you had trouble with a manager, and how you handled it.

Skilled interviewers who also understand the topic ask high level questions where your answers will demonstrate your overall thinking process. They may ask you to do a coding exercise, but unlike the completely unskilled interviewers, they won't ask you to do it on your own and submit it, but will sit with you while you do it, and ask you your thoughts.  
1.  For WPF, what are your thoughts about creating custom controls?  
2.  Do you believe that one must always use MVVM for WPF, or can they sometimes put things in the code behind? (The right answer to this is based on the personality of the person, and there is no right answer, so give a reason as to what you answer.)
3.  What are your thoughts on Continuous Integration?
4.  How do you first approach a project?
5.  When might you use Dependency Injection?
